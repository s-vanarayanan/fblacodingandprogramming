# FBLA Coding and Programming

This project creates an interface which tracks student involvement in various activities throughout the school year. When a student attends an activity, they are awarded points based on the type of activity. At the end of each quarter, a random student from each grade level who attended any event during that quarter is entered into a random lottery for a prize. Additionally, the top point winner of all grades is awarded a prize as well.


The aim of this application is to increase student interest and participation in school activities, through the chance of prizes.
